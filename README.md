# Flatiron-bnb: Associations

We're going to build Airbnb. Really. We're going to take this in steps. First let's work on our model associations and writing migrations. This will be challenging, but doable. Take is slow and work together. Follow the model specs and <em>read the resources below</em>.

<em>Before anything</em>, note that when you generate models, controllers, etc, be sure to include this option, so that it skips tests (which we already have): `--no-test-framework`
