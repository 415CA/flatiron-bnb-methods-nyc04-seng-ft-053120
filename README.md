# Flatiron-bnb: Methods

In the previous iteration, we built out our model associations and migrated our database. Now we're going to work on building useful methods (class and instance) for rendering data and our own validations. We're doing this to follow the principle that our controllers should be skinny, our models fat, so therefore our views have very little logic in them.

<em>Before anything</em>, note that when you generate models, controllers, etc, be sure to include this option, so that it skips tests (which we already have): `--no-test-framework`

## Instructions

There are many methods and validations and callbacks to build! <em>Work together</em>. Get the tests to pass. Read the resources listed.

### Hints

You will need to make a few new migrations.
